#Validanguage Overview

Validanguage is an inheritance-driven, open source javascript validation library designed to be the most feature-rich, user-friendly javascript validation frameworks available. It has been verified to work in all major browsers, including Internet Explorer (versions 6+), Firefox, Safari, Opera, Konqueror and Chrome. A few of the major features of the library are listed below:
* The documentation, and the functionality itself, was designed for use by both javascript-savvy Web developers and those with no experience writing javascript.
* 100% unobtrusive javascript, name-spaced under the global validanguage object. No inline event handlers required (not even to block form submissions)
* No external libraries required (optional Prototype, Dojo or jQuery integration)
* Use inheritance to manage your validation settings. Define a setting globally, per-form, or per-element.
* Supports a choice of two APIs:
  * HTML-like API placed inside comment tags. The choice for ease of use and simplicity.
  * Javascript Object-based API. For advanced configuration.
* Cutting-edge ajax support with integrated caching mechanism and timeout behavior
* Easily configure custom validation functions to be triggered onblur, onsubmit, onchange, etc.
* Add onsuccess and onerror callback functions to integrate Validanguage into your existing site design.
* All validation functions and onsuccess/onerror callbacks are scoped so that the this keyword refers to the validated element.
* Easy-to-use keypress suppression.
* Includes numerous useful "transformation" functions to aid in producing slick forms that dynamically respond to users' input
